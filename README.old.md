# WhatsTypescript
what is typescript?

there is this language, [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
Microsoft maintains it, it's become a very intersting contender for the best new front end language.
It's different in that it is is _strongly-typed_ but at it's code it is bascially Javascript.

You job is learn enough about Typescript to build a pretty simple app.

Build a "web based" Dictionary app. 
The app has a single page, like a very simple google interface, where the user types in an english word and gets a defintion of the word.

For the source of your definitions, use this API: 
`https://dictionaryapi.dev`

For your page styling I have used: `https://getbootstrap.com` 
There is a simple [html page sample](index.html) to get you started.
It's an example of using bootstrap for styling a page without a lot of effort.

Write a program in Typescript to handle the action of calling the dictionary api from the page, and displaying the result, in a nice fashion.

Demos on Monday!
